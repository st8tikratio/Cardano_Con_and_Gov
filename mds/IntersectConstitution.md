# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION

## PREAMBLE

In the beginning of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, three pioneering entities, IOHK,
Emurgo, and the Cardano Foundation, came together to foster the emergence of a new
blockchain, the Cardano Blockchain, laying the foundation for a decentralized network that
would empower individuals, and promote collaboration and innovation. Their pioneering efforts
have shaped the path for a blockchain designed to ensure a fair and transparent environment
where all participants can contribute to the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem's growth and success.

Over time, the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem has expanded significantly, and now, the Cardano
Blockchain ecosystem, comprising of thousands of ada holders, individuals, builders, developers,
enterprises, stake pools, users of the Cardano Blockchain and others, operates in a truly
decentralized manner, further strengthening the resilience and autonomy of the Cardano
Blockchain ecosystem.

As the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem continues to grow, it has become imperative to similarly
adapt and evolve its governance model, reflecting the principles of decentralization, community
involvement, inclusivity and collaboration that have been the cornerstone of the Cardano
Blockchain ecosystem since its start.

Recognizing the need for a more robust and dynamic governance framework, and one that
utilizes wherever possible and beneficial blockchain technology in the governance process, the
Cardano community, as the members of this decentralized Cardano Blockchain ecosystem,
hereby establishes this Cardano Constitution. It shall serve as a guiding set of principles for the
operation and governance of our collective efforts, fostering an environment where all
participants can contribute to the betterment of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem as a whole.

Through adopting this Constitution, the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem shall establish a robust
governance framework, ensuring that decisions are made in the best interest of the Cardano
community. The Cardano community shall uphold principles of transparency, openness, and
responsible governance, promoting a culture of trust and collaboration. Together, the Cardano
community commits to uphold these principles and to work together towards the continuous
improvement, growth, and success of our decentralized blockchain ecosystem known as the
Cardano Blockchain.

This Constitution shall serve as the embodiment of these guiding principles for the operation and
governance of the decentralized Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, providing a foundation that will
adapt and evolve over time to meet the continuing needs of the Cardano community.

All members of the Cardano community are expected to abide by this Constitution, and are
entitled to participate in its governance processes, and are encouraged to work collaboratively
towards the betterment of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem as a whole, contributing to its
growth, sustainability, and success. The Cardano Blockchain shall be governed on a vote-based
decision-making model, fostering inclusivity, a diversity of views, innovation and adaptability.

All owners of ada shall have the opportunity to contribute to the governance and direction of the
decentralized Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

In approaching this Constitution, it must be remembered that this is not a constitution for only a
blockchain but rather, it is a constitution for a blockchain ecosystem – a much more ambitious
endeavor. Accordingly, how governance actions are approved, while extremely important, is not
the sole focus of this Constitution. Rather, this Constitution provides the basis and fundamental
framework through which all actors in the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem can come together to
govern themselves and form radically new approaches to human interaction and collaboration.

By necessity, this Constitution recognizes the role of and empowers the Constitutional
Committee, confirms the right of the Cardano community to participate in collective bodies for
collaboration, gives effect to on-chain governance, and empowers DReps to act as the voice of
ada owners for on-chain voting.

The Constitution also recognizes the necessity of safeguarding access to and the use of funds of
the Cardano treasury through the inclusion of the Cardano Guardrails in this Constitution.

## ARTICLE I. CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN TENETS AND GUARDRAILS

### Section 1

These below Tenets shall guide all actors in the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem including the
Constitutional Committee and proposed governance actions shall be evaluated in accordance
with these Tenets.

Transactions on the Cardano Blockchain should not be slowed down or censored and should be
expediently served for their intended purpose. The Cardano Blockchain should scale taking into
consideration throughput, sharding, settlement and dynamic pricing.

The cost of transactions on the Cardano Blockchain should be predictable and not unreasonable.
The Cardano Blockchain should facilitate an accessible, predictable pricing model.

Anyone desiring to develop and deploy applications on the Cardano Blockchain should not
unreasonably be prevented from developing and deploying such applications as intended. The
Cardano community should promote features to assist in developing and deploying applications
such as digital subscriber lines, formal verification support, asynchronous and scalable location
services, oracles and access to partnerchains.

Contributions by Cardano community on the Cardano Blockchain should be recognized,
recorded and assessed fairly by the Cardano community through reward sharing with SPOs and
DReps, appropriate tokenomics and multi-resource consensus approaches.

The Cardano Blockchain shall not lock in an ada owner’s value without an owner’s consent. The
Cardano Blockchain should promote interoperability and access to partnerchains.

The Cardano Blockchain shall preserve in a safe manner any value and information an owner of
ada seeks to store on the Cardano Blockchain. To assure safe protection of value and
information, the Cardano Blockchain should focus on integrity, post-quantum security,
decentralization and decentralized storage, access to stablecoins and robust key management
approaches.

The Cardano Blockchain shall not unnecessarily spend resources. The Cardano Blockchain shall
promote efficient design, memory and storage.

All users of the Cardano Blockchain shall be treated equally taking into account the collective
desires of the Cardano Blockchain community consistent with the long-term sustainability and
viability of the Cardano Blockchain. Long-term sustainability and viability shall be evaluated by
a number of considerations including fairness, neutrality, sustainability, robust governance,
promotion of decentralized identity, use of multi-resource consensus and democratic
participation by all members of the Cardano community.

#### Workshop Questions

- Do you believe these tenets appropriately reflect the ethos of the Cardano Blockchain?
- Should there be an additional tenet addressing financial sustainability? If yes, what
should it contain? Should it include an absolute cap on the circulating supply of ada?

### Section 2

The Cardano Blockchain shall operate in accordance with the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails as
set forth in the Guardrails Appendix to this Constitution. The Cardano community may from
time to time digitally codify certain Cardano Blockchain Guardrails such that such Cardano
Blockchain Guardrails are directly programmed and implemented on the Cardano Blockchain
using on-chain scripts or built-in ledger rules.

In the event there are inconsistencies between a Cardano Blockchain Guardrail as set forth in the
Guardrails Appendix and any such Cardano Blockchain Guardrail that has been programmed and
implemented on the Cardano Blockchain, the version of such Cardano Blockchain Guardrail that
has been deployed directly on the Cardano Blockchain shall prevail and the Constitutional
Committee shall seek to reconcile such inconsistencies through the encouragement of an
appropriate on-chain governance action.

## ARTICLE II. THE CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN COMMUNITY

### Section 1

No formal membership shall be required to use, participate in and benefit from the Cardano
Blockchain. Instead, all owners of ada, all developers of, all those building on, and all those
otherwise supporting, maintaining or using the Cardano Blockchain are beneficiaries of the
Cardano Blockchain ecosystem and, as such, are collectively members of the Cardano

community. All Cardano community members are accordingly beneficiaries of this Constitution,
entitled to its rights, privileges and protections and, as such, are expected to support and uphold
this Constitution.

### Section 2

Members of the Cardano community who own ada _[, as well as their appointed designees,]_ are
entitled to access and participate in the on-chain decision-making processes of the Cardano
Blockchain ecosystem, including voting and taking part in on-chain governance regarding the
Cardano Blockchain.

#### Workshop Questions

- Should on-chain governance participation be limited to only owners of ada or should
ada owners be allowed to appoint designees who are then entitled to participate in on-
chain governance? [Note that this is not a reference to delegation to DReps.

### Section 3

Members of the Cardano community have a responsibility to maintain the integrity of the
Cardano Blockchain ecosystem by following this Constitution, operating the Cardano
Blockchain network, participating in Cardano Blockchain governance activities, and resolving
disputes in a fair and transparent manner.

### Section 4

The Cardano community is entitled and encouraged through the provisions of this Constitution to
collaborate in developing, maintaining and building applications for the Cardano community,
and to form temporary and permanent organizations and entities as the Cardano community
deems desirable or appropriate in support of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

## ARTICLE III. PARTICIPATORY GOVERNANCE

### Section 1

The Cardano Blockchain ecosystem shall be governed by a decentralized, on-chain governance
model, utilizing, to the extent possible and beneficial, smart contracts and other blockchain-
based tools to facilitate decision-making and ensure transparency. On-chain voting for
governance actions shall follow the process outlined in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

### Section 2

Three independent governance bodies shall participate in voting for on-chain governance actions
to provide checks and balances for the Cardano Blockchain consisting of Delegated
Representatives (DRep), Stake Pool Operators (SPO) and the Constitutional Committee (CC).

### Section 3

On-chain governance decisions shall be made through a collective decision-making process, with
specific consensus threshold requirements as required by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.
All on-chain governance actions shall be voted upon in accordance with the Cardano Blockchain
Guardrails.

### Section 4

All owners of ada _[, as well as their appointed designees,]_ shall have the right to vote in on-chain
governance action decision-making processes, subject to any restrictions or requirements
provided for in this Constitution and the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

#### Workshop Questions

- Voting rights are in proportion to the ada owned. However, should the Constitution
specify a specific voting model?
- Should the Constitution enshrine one ada one vote?
- How do we address participation by institutions? Should holders of ada who are not
owners, such as exchanges, be allowed to vote?

All owners of ada _[, as well as their appointed designees,]_ shall have the right to propose changes
to the governance structure of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem in accordance with the
Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

### Section 5

A special form of governance action exists to allow community sentiment to be gauged without
committing to any on-chain change of the Cardano Blockchain. "Info" actions have no on-chain
effect other than to record the outcome of such a vote on the Cardano Blockchain.

### Section 6

Any proposed on-chain governance action shall require a standardized and legible format
including a URL and hash linked to documented off-chain content. Sufficient rationale shall be
provided to justify the requested change to the Cardano Blockchain. The rationale shall include,
at a minimum, a title, abstract, reason for the proposal, and relevant supporting materials.

Any governance action proposal reaching the on-chain governance stage shall be identical in
content as to the final off-chain version of such governance action proposal.

“Hard Fork Initiation” and “Protocol Parameter Change” governance actions should undergo
sufficient technical review and scrutiny as mandated by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails to
ensure that the governance action does not endanger the security, functionality or performance of
the Cardano Blockchain. On-chain governance actions should address their expected impact on
the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

All owners of ada shall have the right to ensure that the process for participating in, submitting
and voting on on-chain governance actions is open and transparent and is protected from undue
influence and manipulation.

### Section 7

The Cardano community is expected to support the creation, maintenance and ongoing
administration of off-chain governance processes as may be necessary to give effect to this
Constitution and to ensure that there is awareness of and an opportunity to debate and shape all
future governance actions for the Cardano Blockchain.

### Section 8

The Cardano community is expected to propose, not less than on an annual basis, a budget for
the ongoing maintenance and future development of the Cardano Blockchain. All owners of
ada _[, as well as their appointed designees,]_ are expected to periodically approve the Cardano
Blockchain budget through an on-chain governance action. No withdrawals from the Cardano
treasury shall be permitted unless a budget for the Cardano Blockchain is then in effect as
required by the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails.

_[Any governance action requesting ada from the Cardano Blockchain treasury in excess of
[1,000,000] ada shall require an allocation of ada as a part of such funding request to cover the
cost of periodic independent audits and the implementation of oversight metrics as to the use of
such ada.] [Contractual obligations governing the use of ada received from the Cardano
Blockchain treasury pursuant to a Cardano budget in excess of [1,000,000] shall include dispute
resolution provisions.]_

#### Workshop Questions

- Should the Constitution require that governance actions above a specified amount
include allocations of ada to cover periodic audits and implementation of oversight
metrics? If yes, how should they be enforced?
- Should the Constitution require that contractual provisions governing the use of ada
received from the treasury above a specified amount include dispute resolution
provisions? If yes, how should they be enforced?
- Should the Constitution require that the budget include a contingency fund? If so, how
would it work? What could it be used for? Who would administer it?
- Should the Constitution require that the budget include an indemnity fund to cover
potential claims against governance participants such as DReps and Constitutional
Committee members? If so, how would it work? What could it be used for? Who would
administer it?
- Should the budgetary process be spelled out in greater detail in the Constitution? Should
the Constitution identify how the budget will be administered? Should it identify who
will administer the budget?
- Should the Constitution specify a cap on the annual budget?

## ARTICLE IV. DELEGATED REPRESENTATIVES

### Section 1

In order to participate in governance actions, owners of ada may register as DReps and directly
vote on such governance actions or may delegate their voting rights to other registered DReps
who shall vote on their behalf.

### Section 2

Any owner of ada shall have the option to register as a DRep. Any owner of ada _[, as well as
their appointed designees,]_ shall be allowed to delegate their voting stake to one or more
registered DReps, including themselves. DReps may be individuals or coordinated groups.
DReps are entitled to cast votes directly for on-chain governance actions and represent those ada
holders delegating their voting rights to them.

This voting system shall enshrine a liquid democracy model where owners of ada can seamlessly
select among DReps, register as a DRep, and change their delegation at any time.

### Section 3

_[DReps are expected to adopt codes of conduct from time to time governing their activities as
DReps and make such codes of conduct publicly available.]_

#### Workshop Questions

- Should the Constitution include any guidelines as to the requirements that must be
included by DReps in their respective codes of conduct?
- Should there be one code of conduct for all DReps or should each DRep be allowed to
adopt its own code of conduct? Should DRep codes of conduct be on-chain?
- Should the Constitutional Committee determine whether such codes of conduct are
consistent with the Constitution?
- Should the Constitution include term limits for DReps?

### Section 4

The Cardano community is expected to support the creation, maintenance and ongoing
administration of tools to enable owners of ada to explore and evaluate DRep candidates and
select DReps on such criteria as they deem relevant.

### Section 5

_[DReps may be compensated for their efforts to foster the creation of a professional governance
cohort for the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem. DReps shall ensure that any compensation
received in connection with their activities as a DRep is disclosed. DReps may not otherwise
purchase voting rights.]_

#### Workshop Questions

- Should the Constitution mandate compensation for DReps? If so, should the Constitution
specify how compensation is determined or include a cap on compensation?
- Should the Constitution require that budgets approved for the Cardano Blockchain
include an allocation from the Cardano Blockchain treasury sufficient to compensate
DReps in such amounts as may be approved from time to time by ada owners.

## ARTICLE V. STAKE POOL OPERATORS

### Section 1

SPOs shall have a specific role in approving critical on-chain governance actions which require
additional oversight and independence, voting separately and independently from DReps as set
forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails. SPOs shall participate in hard fork initiation
processes as the operators of the nodes that participate in Cardano Blockchain’s consensus
mechanism.

### Section 2

SPOs may act as a check on the power of the Constitutional Committee under exceptional
circumstances by separately voting on "Motion of no-confidence" and "Update
committee/threshold" governance actions.

### Section 3

_[Owners of ada who are both DReps and SPOs shall either refrain from voting in on-chain
governance actions in both capacities or shall publicly disclose that they are participating in on-
chain governance actions in both such capacities prior to exercising any on-chain governance
rights.]_

#### Workshop Questions

- Should the Constitution include a requirement that ada owners who are both DReps and
SPOs either refrain from voting in both capacities or disclose such dual roles?
- Should the Constitution include other conflicts of interest provisions included?
- Should the Constitution require that SPOs be expected to implement codes of conduct? If
yes, should they be on-chain? Should the Constitutional Committee determine whether
such codes of conduct are consistent with the Constitution?]

## ARTICLE VI. CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE

### Section 1

A Constitutional Committee shall be established as the branch of Cardano's on-chain governance
process that ensures governance actions are consistent with this Constitution. The Constitutional
Committee shall comprise a set of owners of ada _[, including their appointed designees,]_ that is
collectively responsible for ensuring that on-chain governance actions prior to enactment on-
chain, are constitutional. The Constitutional Committee shall be limited to voting on the
constitutionality of governance actions. Constitutional Committee members are expected to have
appropriate expertise to carry out their required responsibilities, considering their past
contributions and involvement in the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem.

### Section 2

The Constitutional Committee shall be composed of _[such number of members as shall be
determined from time to time by owners of ada]_ , as consistent with the Cardano Blockchain
Guardrails, and as shall be sufficient to assure the ongoing integrity of the Cardano Blockchain.

#### Workshop Questions

- Should the Constitution specify

### Section 2

The Constitutional Committee shall be composed of _[such number of members as shall be
determined from time to time by owners of ada]_ , as consistent with the Cardano Blockchain
Guardrails, and as shall be sufficient to assure the ongoing integrity of the Cardano Blockchain.

#### Workshop Questions

- Should the Constitution specify how the number of members of the CC are determined?
[Note that the Guardrails specify both a minimum and maximum number of members.]

Members of the Constitutional Committee shall serve such terms _[as shall be determined from
time to time by owners of ada]_ as consistent with the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails, provided
that terms shall not be less than one year. To assure continuity in the operation of Constitutional
Committee, the terms for Constitutional Committee members shall be staggered.

#### Workshop Questions

- Should the Constitution specify how term limits for CC members are determined? [Note
that the Guardrails specify both a minimum and maximum term limit.]

### Section 3

The Cardano community shall establish a process from time to time for election of members of
the Constitutional Committee consistent with the requirements of the Cardano Blockchain
Guardrails.

#### Workshop Questions

- Should the Constitution include an explicit process for the election of members of the
CC?

### Section 4

No governance action, other than a "Motion of no-confidence" or "Update constitutional
committee/threshold" may be implemented on-chain unless the Constitutional Committee shall
have first determined and affirmed through an on-chain action that such proposal does not violate
this Constitution.

The Constitutional Committee shall be considered to be in one of the following two states at all
times: a state of confidence or a state of no-confidence. In a state of no-confidence, members of
the then standing Constitutional Committee must be reinstated or replaced using the "Update
committee/threshold" governance action before any other on-chain governance action may go
forward.

### Section 5

Constitutional Committee processes shall be transparent. The Constitutional Committee shall
publish each decision. When voting _[no]_ on a proposal, _[the Constitutional Committee] [each
member of the Constitutional committee casting a no vote]_ shall set forth the basis for its
decision with reference to specific Articles of this Constitution that are in conflict with a given
proposal.

The Constitutional Committee shall operate pursuant to a code of conduct published by the
Constitutional Committee from time to time and shall adopt such policies and procedures as the
Constitutional Committee shall deem necessary in carrying out its duties.

#### Workshop Questions

- Should the Constitution require that the Constitutional Committee code of conduct be on-
chain?
- Should the community have any role in approving the Constitutional Committee code of
conduct? If so, how would this work?

### Section 6

The Cardano community is expected to support the creation, maintenance and ongoing
administration of tools as may be necessary and appropriate for the Constitutional Committee to
perform its required functions.

### Section 7

_[Constitutional Committee members may be compensated for their efforts as members of the
Constitutional Committee. Constitutional Committee members shall ensure that any
compensation received in connection with their activities as a member is disclosed.] [Budgets
approved for the Cardano Blockchain shall include allocations from the Cardano Blockchain
treasury sufficient to [compensate Constitutional Committee members in such amounts as may
be approved from time to time by ada owners] and to provide for periodic administrative costs
of the Constitutional Committee in such amounts as requested from time to time by the
Constitutional Committee.]_

#### Workshop Questions

- Should the Constitution mandate compensation for CC members? If so, should the
Constitution specify how compensation is determined or include a cap on compensation?
- Should the Constitution require that budgets approved for the Cardano Blockchain
include an allocation from the Cardano Blockchain treasury sufficient to compensate CC
members in such amounts as may be approved from time to time by ada owners.
- Should the Constitution require that the budget include an allocation for the
administrative costs of the CC? If so, how should the amount be determined? If so,
should the Constitution specify who would administer such a budget and whether
expenditures by the CC should be public or subject to audit oversight?

## ARTICLE VII. AMENDMENTS

### Section 1

Except as otherwise so provided in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, amendments
to this Constitution, including to the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, shall be
approved by a collective decision-making process, requiring an on-chain governance action by
owners of ada _[, including their appointed designees,]_ satisfying a threshold of not less than 67%
of the then active voting stake.

### Section 2

If the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix sets forth an amendment threshold for a
Cardano Blockchain Guardrail that is different than the amendment threshold contained in
Section 1 of this Article VII, then the threshold set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails
Appendix for such Cardano Blockchain Guardrail shall apply.

#### Workshop Questions

- Should the Constitution include a provision preventing Article VII itself from being
amended or allowing any governance action that would have the effect of changing these
amendment requirements?
- Should the Constitution include a category of technical guardrail modifications that
could be overseen and approved by the Constitutional Committee? Is this even possible?
If yes, should such a category be narrowly defined to only address high security risks or
emergency issues?

## APPENDIX I: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS

### 1. INTRODUCTION

To implement Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance pursuant to CIP-1694, it is necessary to
establish sensible guardrails that will enable the Cardano Blockchain to continue to operate in a
secure and sustainable way.

This Appendix sets forth guardrails that must be applied to Cardano Blockchain on-chain
governance actions, including changes to the protocol parameters and limits on treasury
withdrawals. These guardrails cover both essential, intrinsic limits on settings, and
recommendations that are based on experience, measurement and governance objectives.

These guardrails are designed to avoid unexpected problems with the operation of the Cardano
Blockchain. They are intended to guide the choice of sensible parameter settings and avoid
potential problems with security, performance or functionality. As described below, some of
these guardrails are automatable and will be enforced via an on-chain script or built-in ledger
rules.

These guardrails apply to the Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 mainnet environment. They are not
intended to apply to test environments or to other blockchains that use the Cardano Blockchain
software.

Not all parameters for the Cardano Blockchain can be considered independently. Some
parameters interact with other settings in an intrinsic way. Where known, these interactions are
addressed in this Appendix.

While the guardrails in this Appendix presently reflect the current state of technical insight, this
Appendix should be treated as a living document. Implementation improvements, new
simulations or performance evaluation results for the Cardano Blockchain may allow some of the
restrictions contained in these guardrails to be relaxed (or, in some circumstances, require them
to be tightened) in due course.

Additional guardrails may also be needed where, for example, new protocol parameters are
introduced.

The guardrails set forth in this Appendix may be amended from time to time pursuant to an on-
chain governance action that satisfies the applicable voting threshold as set forth in this
Appendix. Any such amendment to any guardrails shall require and be deemed to be an
amendment to the Constitution itself.

#### Workshop Questions

- Should any of the below Guardrails include an amendment threshold different from the
threshold included in Article VII?

### Terminology and Guidance

**Should/Should not.** Where this Appendix says that a value "should not" be set below or
above some value, this means that the guardrail is a recommendation or guideline, and the
specific value could be open to discussion or alteration by a suitably expert group recognized by
the Cardano community in light of experience with the Cardano Blockchain governance system
or the operation of the Cardano Blockchain.

**Must/Must not.** Where this Appendix says that a value "must not" be set below or above
some value, this means that the guardrail is a requirement that will be enforced by Cardano
Blockchain ledger rules, types or other built-in mechanisms where possible, and that if not
followed could cause a protocol failure, security breach or other undesirable outcome.

**Benchmarking.** Benchmarking refers to careful system level performance evaluation that is
designed to show a-priori that, for example, 95% of blocks will be diffused across a global
network of Cardano Blockchain nodes within the required 5s time interval in all cases. This may
require construction of specific test workflows and execution on a large test network of Cardano
nodes, simulating a global Cardano Blockchain network.

**Performance analysis.** Performance analysis refers to projecting theoretical performance,
empirical benchmarking or simulation results to predict actual system behavior. For example,
performance results obtained from tests in a controlled test environment (such as a collection of
data centers with known networking properties) may be extrapolated to inform likely
performance behavior in a real Cardano Blockchain network environment.

**Simulation.** Simulation refers to synthetic execution that is designed to inform
performance/functionality decisions in a repeatable way. For example, the IOSim Cardano
Blockchain module allows the operation of the networking stack to be simulated in a controlled
and repeatable way, allowing issues to be detected before code deployment.

**Performance Monitoring.** Performance monitoring involves measuring the actual behavior
of the Cardano Blockchain network, for example, by using timing probes to evaluate round-trip
times, or test blocks to assess overall network health. It complements benchmarking and
performance analysis by providing information about actual system behavior that cannot be
obtained using simulated workloads or theoretical analysis.

**Reverting Changes.** Where performance monitoring shows that actual network behavior
following a change is inconsistent with the performance requirements for the Cardano
Blockchain, then the change must be reverted to its previous state if that is possible. For
example, if the block size is increased from 100KB to 120KB and 95% of blocks are no longer
diffused within 5s, then a change must be made to revert the block size to 100KB. If this is not
possible, then one or more alternative changes must be made that will ensure that the
performance requirements are met.

**Severity Levels.** Issues that affect the Cardano Blockchain network are classified by
severity level, where:

- Severity 1 is a critical incident or issue with very high impact to the security,
performance, or functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network.
- Severity 2 is a major incident or issue with significant impact to the security,
performance, or functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network.
- Severity 3 is a minor incident or issue with low impact to the security, performance, or
functionality of the Cardano Blockchain network.

**Future Performance Requirements.** Planned development such as new mechanisms for out-
of-memory storage may impact block diffusion or other times. When changing parameters, it is
necessary to consider these future performance requirements as well as the current operation of
the Cardano Blockchain. Until development is complete, the requirements will be conservative;
they may then be relaxed to account for actual timing behavior.

### Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")

A script hash is associated with the constitution hash when a **New Constitution or Guardrails
Script** governance action is enacted. It acts as an additional safeguard to the ledger rules and
types, filtering non-compliant governance actions.

The guardrails script only affects two types of governance actions:

- **Parameter Update** actions, and
- **Treasury Withdrawal** actions.

The script is executed when either of these types of governance action is submitted on-chain.
This avoids scenarios where, for example, an erroneous script could prevent the chain from ever
enacting a Hard Fork action, resulting in deadlock. There are three different situations that apply
to script usage.

**Symbol and Explanation**

- (y) The script can be used to enforce the guardrail.
- (x) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail.
- (~ - reason) The script cannot be used to enforce the guardrail for the reason given, but
future ledger changes could enable this.

Guardrails may overlap: in this case, the most restrictive set of guardrails will apply.

Where a parameter is not explicitly listed in this document, then the script **must not** permit
any changes to the parameter.

Conversely, where a parameter is explicitly listed in this document but no checkable guardrails
are specified, the script **must not** impose any constraints on changes to the parameter.

### 2. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON PROTOCOL PARAMETER UPDATE ACTIONS

Below are guardrails and guidelines for changing updatable protocol parameter settings via the
protocol parameter update governance action such that the Cardano Blockchain is never in an
unrecoverable state as a result of such changes.

Note that there are at least five different sources of parameter names, and these are not always
consistent:

1. The name used in the Genesis file
2. The name used in protocol parameter update governance actions
3. The name used internally in ledger rules
4. The name used in the formal ledger specification
5. The name used in research papers

Where these parameter names differ, this Appendix uses the second convention.

#### Guardrails

**PARAM-01** (y) Any protocol parameter that is not explicitly named in this document **must
not** be changed by a Parameter update governance action.

**PARAM-02** (y) Where a protocol parameter is explicitly listed in this document but no
checkable guardrails are specified, the guardrails script **must not** impose any constraints on
changes to the parameter. Checkable guardrails are shown by a (y).

### 2.1. Critical Protocol Parameters

The below protocol parameters are critical from a security point of view.

_Parameters that are Critical to the Operation of the Blockchain_

- *maximum block body size* (*maxBlockBodySize*)
- *maximum transaction size* (*maxTxSize*)
- *maximum block header size* (*maxBlockHeaderSize*)
- *maximum size of a serialized asset value* (*maxValueSize*)
- *maximum script execution/memory units in a single block* (*maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps/memory]*)
- *minimum fee coefficient* (*txFeePerByte*)
- *minimum fee constant* (*txFeeFixed*)
- *minimum fee per byte for reference scripts* (*minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte*)
- *minimum Lovelace deposit per byte of serialized UTxO* (*utxoCostPerByte*)
- *governance action deposit* (*govDeposit*)

#### Guardrails

**PARAM-03** (y) Critical protocol parameters require an SPO vote in addition to a DRep vote: SPOs **must** say "yes" with a collective support of more than 50% of all active block production stake. This is enforced by the guardrails on the stake pool voting threshold.

**PARAM-04** (x) At least 3 months **should** normally pass between the publication of an off-chain proposal to change a critical protocol parameter and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action. This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

_Parameters that are Critical to the Governance System_

- *delegation key Lovelace deposit* (*stakeAddressDeposit*)
- *pool registration Lovelace deposit* (*stakePoolDeposit*)
- *minimum fixed rewards cut for pools* (*minPoolCost*)
- *DRep deposit amount* (*dRepDeposit*)
- *minimal Constitutional Committee size* (*committeeMinSize*)
- *maximum term length (in epochs) for the Constitutional Committee members* (*committeeMaxTermLimit*)

#### Guardrails

**PARAM-05** (y) DReps **must** vote "yes" with a collective support of more than 50% of all active voting stake. This is enforced by the guardrails on the DRep voting thresholds.

**PARAM-06** (x) At least 3 months **should** normally pass between the publication of an off-chain proposal to change a parameter that is critical to the governance system and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action. This guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.

### 2.2. Economic Parameters

The overall goals when managing economic parameters are to:

1. Enable long-term economic sustainability for the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem;
2. Ensure that stake pools are adequately rewarded for maintaining the Cardano Blockchain;
3. Ensure that ada holders are adequately rewarded for using stake in constructive ways, including when delegating ada for block production; and
4. Balance economic incentives for different Cardano Blockchain ecosystem stakeholders, including but not limited to Stake Pool Operators, ada holders, DeFi users, infrastructure users, developers (e.g., DApps), and financial intermediaries (e.g., exchanges).

_Triggers for Change_

1. Significant changes in the fiat value of ada resulting in potential problems with security, performance, or functionality.
2. Changes in transaction volumes or types.
3. Community requests or suggestions.
4. Emergency situations that require changes to economic parameters.

- Transaction volumes and types.
- Number and health of stake pools.
- External economic factors.

_Changes to Specific Economic Parameters_

**Transaction fee per byte (txFeePerByte) and fixed transaction fee (txFeeFixed)**

Defines the cost for basic transactions in Lovelace:

fee(tx) = txFeeFixed + txFeePerByte x nBytes(tx)

#### Guardrails

**TFPB-01** (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** be lower than 30 (0.000030 ada). This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks.

**TFPB-02** (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** exceed 1,000 (0.001 ada). This ensures that transactions can be paid for.

**TFPB-03** (y) *txFeePerByte* **must not** be negative.

**TFF-01** (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** be lower than 100,000 (0.1 ada). This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks.

**TFF-02** (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** exceed 10,000,000 (10 ada). This ensures that transactions can be paid for.

**TFF-03** (y) *txFeeFixed* **must not** be negative.

**TFGEN-01** (x - "should") To maintain a consistent level of protection against denial-of-service attacks, *txFeeFixed* and *txFeePerByte* **should** be adjusted whenever Plutus Execution prices are adjusted (executionUnitPrices[steps/memory]).

**TFGEN-02** (x - unquantifiable) Any changes to *txFeeFixed* or *txFeePerByte* **must** consider the implications of reducing the cost of a denial-of-service attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee so that it becomes impossible to construct a transaction.

_UTxO cost per byte (utxoCostPerByte)_

Defines the cost for storage in UTxOs:

- Sets a minimum threshold on ada that is held within a single UTxO (~1 ada minimum, could be >= 50 ada in the worst case).
- Provides protection against low-cost denial of service attack on UTxO storage. This attack has been executed on other chains; it is not theoretical.
- DoS protection decreases in line with the free node memory (proportional to UTxO growth).
- Helps reduce long-term storage costs.
- Provides an incentive to return UTxOs when no longer needed.
- Should significantly exceed minimum tx cost (~0.15 ada).

#### Guardrails

**UCPB-01** (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** be lower than 3,000 (0.003 ada).

**UCPB-02** (y) *utxoCostPerByte* **must not** exceed 6,500 (0.0065 ada).

ii) The acceptable time for an attack (at least one epoch is assumed).
iii) The acceptable memory configuration for full node users (assumed to be 16GB for wallets or 24GB for stake pools).
iv) The sizes of UTxOs (~200B per UTxO minimum, up to about 10KB).
v) The current total node memory usage.

_Stake address deposit (stakeAddressDeposit)_

Ensures that stake addresses are retired when no longer needed:

- Helps reduce long-term storage costs.
- Helps limit CPU and memory costs in the ledger.

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required. Reducing the number of active stake addresses also reduces processing and memory costs at the epoch boundary when calculating stake snapshots.

#### Guardrails

**SAD-01** (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** be lower than 1,000,000 (1 ada).

**SAD-02** (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** exceed 5,000,000 (5 ada).

**SAD-03** (y) *stakeAddressDeposit* **must not** be negative.

_Stake pool deposit (stakePoolDeposit)_

Ensures that stake pools are retired by the stake pool operator when no longer needed by them:

- Helps reduce long-term storage costs.

The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required. Rewards and stake snapshot calculations are also impacted by the number of active stake pools.

#### Guardrails

**SPD-01** (y) *stakePoolDeposit* **must not** be lower than 250,000,000 (250 ada).

**SPD-02** (y) *stakePoolDeposit* **must not** exceed 500,000,000 (500 ada).

**MPC-02** (y) *minPoolCost* **must not** exceed 500,000,000 (500 ada).

**MPC-03** (x - "should") *minPoolCost* **should** be set in line with the economic cost for operating a pool.

__Treasury Cut (treasuryCut)_

Part of the rewards mechanism:

- The treasury cut portion of the monetary expansion is transferred to the treasury before any pool rewards are paid.
- Can be set in the range 0.0-1.0 (0%-100%).

Part of the rewards mechanism:

- The monetary expansion controls the amount of reserves that is used for rewards each epoch.
- Governs the long-term sustainability of Cardano.
- The reserves are gradually depleted until no rewards are supplied.

#### Guardrails

**ME-01** (y) *monetaryExpansion* **must not** exceed 0.

**ME-02** (y) *monetaryExpansion* **must not** be lower than 0.

**ME-05** (x - "should") *monetaryExpansion* **should not** be changed more than once in any 36-epoch period (approximately 6 months).

_Plutus Script Execution Prices (executionUnitPrices[priceSteps/priceMemory])_

Defines the fees for executing Plutus scripts:

- Gives an economic return for Plutus script execution.
- Provides security against low-cost DoS attacks.

#### Guardrails

**EIUP-PS-01** (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceSteps]* **must not** exceed 2,000 / 10,000,000.

**EIUP-PS-02** (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceSteps]* **must not** be lower than 500 / 10,000,000.

**EIUP-PM-01** (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceMemory]* **must not** exceed 2,000 / 10,000.

**EIUP-PM-02** (y) *executionUnitPrices[priceMemory]* **must not** be lower than 400 / 10,000.

**EIUP-GEN-01** (x - "similar to") The execution prices **must** be set so that:

- i) the cost of executing a transaction with maximum CPU steps is similar to the cost of a maximum-sized non-script transaction and
- ii) the cost of executing a transaction with maximum memory units is similar to the cost of a maximum-sized non-script transaction.

**EIUP-GEN-02** (x - "should") The execution prices **should** be adjusted whenever transaction fees are adjusted (*txFeeFixed/txFeePerByte*). The goal is to ensure that the processing delay is similar for "full" transactions, regardless of their type.

- This helps ensure that the requirements on block diffusion/propagation times are met.

Defines the cost for using Plutus reference scripts in Lovelace.

#### Guardrails

**MFRS-01** (y) *minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte* **must not** exceed 1,000 (0.001 ada).

**MFRS-03** (x - "should") To maintain a consistent level of protection against denial-of-service attacks, *minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte* **should** be adjusted whenever Plutus Execution prices are adjusted (*executionUnitPrices[steps/memory]*) and whenever *txFeeFixed* is adjusted.

**MFRS-04** (x - unquantifiable) Any changes to *minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte* **must** consider the implications of reducing the cost of a denial-of-service attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee.

### 2.3. Network Parameters

### 2.6. Monitoring and Reversion of Parameter Changes

All network parameter changes **must** be monitored carefully for no less than 2 epochs (10 days):

- Changes **must** be reverted as soon as possible if block propagation delays exceed 4.5s for more than 5% of blocks over any 6-hour rolling window.

All other parameter changes should be monitored carefully for any adverse effects on performance, security, or functionality. If such effects are observed, appropriate actions, including reversion to previous parameters, should be taken.

A specific reversion/recovery plan **must be** produced for each parameter change. This plan must include:

- Which parameters need to change and in which ways in order to return to the previous state (or a similar state).
- How to recover the network in the event of a disastrous failure.

This plan **should** be followed if problems are observed following the parameter change. Note that not all changes can be reverted. Additional care must be taken when making changes to these parameters.

### 2.7. Non-Updatable Protocol Parameters

Some fundamental protocol parameters cannot be changed by the Protocol Parameter Update governance action. These parameters can only be changed in a new Genesis file as part of a hard fork. It is not necessary to provide specific guardrails on updating these parameters.

### 3. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON TREASURY WITHDRAWAL ACTIONS

**Treasury withdrawal** actions specify the destination and amount of a number of withdrawals from the Cardano treasury.

#### Guardrails

**TREASURY-01** (x) DReps **must** define a net change limit for the Cardano Treasury's balance per period of time.

**TREASURY-02** (x) The budget for the Cardano Treasury **must not** exceed the net change limit for the Cardano Treasury's balance per period of time.

**TREASURY-03** (x) The budget for the Cardano Treasury **must** be denominated in ada.

**TREASURY-04** (x) Treasury withdrawals **must not** be ratified until there is a community-approved Cardano budget then in effect pursuant to a previous on-chain governance action agreed by the DReps with a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake.

### 4. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON HARD FORK INITIATION ACTIONS

The **hard fork initiation** action requires both a new major and a new minor protocol version to be specified:

- As positive integers.

As the result of a hard fork, new updatable protocol parameters may be introduced. Guardrails may be defined for these parameters, which will take effect following the hard fork. Existing updatable protocol parameters may also be deprecated by the hard fork, in which case the guardrails become obsolete for all future changes.

#### Guardrails

**HARDFORK-01** (~ - no access to existing parameter values) The major protocol version **must** be the same as or one greater than the major version that will be enacted immediately prior to this change. If the major protocol version is one greater, then the minor protocol version **must** be zero.

**HARDFORK-02** (~ - no access to existing parameter values) The minor protocol version **must** be no less than the minor version that will be enacted immediately prior to this change.

**HARDFORK-03** (~ - no access to existing parameter values) At least one of the protocol versions (major or minor or both) **must** change.

**HARDFORK-04** (x) At least 85% of stake pools by active stake **should** have upgraded to a Cardano node version that is capable of processing the rules associated with the new protocol version.

**HARDFORK-05** (x) Any new updatable protocol parameters that are introduced with a hard fork **must** be included in this Appendix and suitable guardrails defined for those parameters.

**HARDFORK-06** (x) Settings for any new protocol parameters that are introduced with a hard fork **must** be included in the appropriate Genesis file.

**HARDFORK-07** (x) Any deprecated protocol parameters **must** be indicated in this Appendix.

**HARDFORK-08** (~ - no access to *Plutus cost model* parameters) New Plutus versions **must** be supported by a version-specific *Plutus cost model* that covers each primitive that is available in the new Plutus version.

### 5. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON UPDATE CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE OR THRESHOLD ACTIONS

**Update Constitutional Committee or Threshold** governance actions may change the size, composition, or required voting thresholds for the Constitutional Committee.

#### Guardrails

**UPDATE-CC-01** (x) **Update Constitutional Committee and/or threshold** **and/or term** governance actions **must not** be ratified until ada holders have ratified through an on-chain governance action the Final Constitution.

### 6. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON NEW CONSTITUTION OR GUARDRAILS SCRIPT ACTIONS

New constitution or guardrails script actions change the hash of the on-chain constitution and the associated guardrails script.

#### Guardrails

**NEW-CONSTITUTION-01** (x) A **New Constitution** **or Guardrails Script** governance action **must** be submitted to define any required guardrails for new parameters that are introduced via a Hard Fork governance action.

### 7. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON NO CONFIDENCE ACTIONS

**No confidence** actions signal a state of no confidence in the governance system. No guardrails are imposed on **No Confidence** actions.

#### Guardrails

- None

### 8. GUARDRAILS AND GUIDELINES ON INFO ACTIONS

**Info** actions are not enacted on-chain. No guardrails are imposed on **Info** actions.

#### Guardrails

- None

### 9. GUARDRAILS DURING THE INTERIM PERIOD

_Interim Period_

The Interim Period begins with the Chang Hard-Fork and ends after a community-ratified Final Constitution is enacted on-chain. Throughout the Interim Period, technical and constitution-enforced triggers will progressively turn on the features of CIP-1694.

_Interim Period Technical Rollout:_

- The Chang Hard Fork will enable three initial CIP-1694 governance actions and enable the representative framework to be established.

These actions are the **"Info"**, **"Hard-fork initiation"**, and **"Protocol parameter changes"** actions.

ada holders will be able to register as and delegate to DReps immediately after the hard fork but, as described in CIP-1694, DRep voting will not be available, except on **"Info"** actions. This ensures that ada holders have sufficient time to choose their voting delegations.

SPOs will be able to vote as described in CIP-1694.

**"Hard-fork initiation"** and **"Protocol parameter changes"** actions will also be ratified by the Constitutional Committee.

ada holders will be able to withdraw their staking rewards as usual.

- A subsequent hard fork, ratified by the Constitutional Committee and SPOs, shortly after the Chang Hard Fork, will enable the four remaining CIP-1694 governance actions:

  - **"Treasury withdrawals"**,
  - **"Motion of no-confidence"**,
  - **"Update constitutional committee and/or threshold and/or terms"**, and
  - **"New constitution or guardrails script"**.

At this point, DRep voting will be enabled and staking rewards can only be withdrawn if the ada holder has delegated their vote (including to the pre-defined Abstain/No Confidence voting options).

#### Guardrails

**INTERIM-01** (x) To provide sufficient time for DReps to register and campaign and for ada holders to choose their initial voting delegations, at least 18 epochs (90 days, or approximately 3 months) **must** elapse after the Chang hard fork before the subsequent hard fork can be ratified. Once the subsequent hard fork is enacted, DRep voting can occur as described in CIP-1694.

**INTERIM-02** (x) Treasury withdrawals **must not** be ratified until there is a community-approved Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem budget then in effect pursuant to a previous on-chain governance action.

**INTERIM-03** (x) Treasury withdrawals **must** be consistent with the community-approved Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budget(s).

**INTERIM-04** (x) ada holders **must** have ratified the Final Constitution as specified in Appendix II before ratifying any other proposed **"new constitution"**, **"update constitutional committee and/or threshold and/or terms"**, and **"motion of no-confidence"** governance actions.

**INTERIM-05** (x) **"New guardrails script"** actions that are consistent with the Interim Constitution may be ratified during the interim period, provided the Interim Constitution itself is not changed.

### 6. CONCLUSION

The implementation of CIP-1694 and the ongoing development of the Cardano governance framework represent a significant step toward a truly decentralized, community-driven ecosystem. By adhering to the principles of transparency, inclusivity, and accountability, the Cardano community can ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the blockchain.

As the governance framework continues to evolve, the active participation and engagement of all stakeholders will be crucial. Through collaboration, education, and a shared commitment to the principles outlined in the Cardano Constitution, the community can achieve its vision of a decentralized, fair, and resilient blockchain ecosystem.

This document, along with the Cardano Constitution, shall serve as a living framework, continuously adapted and improved in response to the needs and aspirations of the Cardano community.
